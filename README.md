first steps to managing my own brand/company and being my own boss


Hello, 

My name is Russell Quintana. I am married to a beautiful woman named Elsie Quintana. We have one son together, James, as of right now. I am learning how to code so i am able to be my own boss and take charge of my work life instead of progressing another persons company/product.
